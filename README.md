# 📚 Creating and Testing APIs with Cypress

Learning to develop RESTful APIs efficiently using Node.js and Express, integrating MongoDB as the database, and automating the entire end-to-end testing process with Cypress.  

## 🛠️ What I Learned in API Development:

Building RESTful APIs with Node.js and Express, structuring routes, and implementing basic CRUD operations.

## 🗃️ Database

Learned how to connect the application to MongoDB using Mongoose, as well as model and manipulate data through schemas.

## 🔍 Testing APIs with Cypress

ACreated tests for each API endpoint, focusing on CRUD operations. Explored techniques to simulate and validate API responses.

## **Tools Used:**

1. **Node.js (versão 20.x LTS)**  
2. **Visual Studio Code**  
3. **Windows Terminal** 
4. **Git Bash**  

## **Project Prompt:**

Develop a RESTful API in Node.js for a book registration system. The API must include the following features:

📌 Book Registration: Allow users to register books by providing title, author, publisher, publication year, and number of pages. All fields are required.
📌 List Books: Implement an endpoint to list all registered books, returning all their details.
📌 Get Book by ID: Create an endpoint to retrieve a specific book by its ID.
📌 Delete Book: Implement an endpoint to remove a book from the system using its ID.
📌 Database: Use MongoDB as the database.

#### **Technical Requirements:**

✅ Use Express.js to manage API routes.
✅ Use Mongoose for data modeling and MongoDB integration.
✅ Include error handling and proper validations for all endpoints.
✅ Add comments in the code to explain key parts of the implementation.

## **Running the API 🚀**

1. Clone the repository and install dependencies:

```bash
npm install
```

2. To start the API, run:

```bash
npm start
```
